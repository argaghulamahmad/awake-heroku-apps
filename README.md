## Description
A free Heroku web dyno will go to sleep if it does not receive any web traffic within a 30 minute period. When a sleeping dyno receives web traffic it will become active again, but there is a short delay as the application needs to be reloaded.

This GitHub action keeps a Heroku dyno awake by making a HTTP request to it every 30 minutes.

Heroku only provides a limited number of free dyno hours per month. The main benefit of a sleeping dyno is that it does not consume free dyno hours. Please ensure you have sufficient free dyno hours to support a 24/7 dyno before using this action.

## Usage
